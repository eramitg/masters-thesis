In addition, we isolated all the large transactions in the system, and discovered that almost all of them are closely related to a single large transaction that took place in November 2010, even though the associated users apparently tried to hide this fact with many strange looking long chains and fork-merge structures in the transaction graph.},

	abstract = {In the traditional scenario in cryptography there is one sender, one receiver and an active or passive eavesdropper who is an opponent. Large bank transactions require two people to sign, implying two senders. So the power to generate a valid transaction is shared. Threshold cryptography allows one to share the power of a cryptosystem. Threshold cryptosystems are distinct from threshold schemes in which the power to regenerate a secret key is shared. A normal threshold scheme is not directly suited for threshold signatures. Using a threshold scheme directly would require the shareholders to send their shares to a trusted person who would apply the cryptosystem for them. But the use of such a trusted person violates the main point of threshold cryptography. We motivate the need for treshold cryptosystems, overview the research in the field, and give some simple examples. We will conclude by giving a list of open problems.},

@inproceedings{andrychowicz_secure_2014,
	title = {Secure {Multiparty} {Computations} on {Bitcoin}},
	abstract = {Bit coin is a decentralized digital currency, introduced in 2008, that has recently gained noticeable popularity. Its main features are: (a) it lacks a central authority that controls the transactions, (b) the list of transactions is publicly available, and (c) its syntax allows more advanced transactions than simply transferring the money. The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bit coin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs). Firstly, we show that the Bit coin system provides an attractive way to construct a version of "timed commitments", where the committer has to reveal his secret within a certain time frame, or to pay a fine. This, in turn, can be used to obtain fairness in some multiparty protocols. Secondly, we introduce a concept of multiparty protocols that work "directly on Bit coin". Recall that the standard definition of the MPCs guarantees only that the protocol "emulates the trusted third party". Hence ensuring that the inputs are correct, and the outcome is respected is beyond the scope of the definition. Our observation is that the Bit coin system can be used to go beyond the standard "emulation-based" definition, by constructing protocols that link their inputs and the outputs with the real Bit coin transactions. As an instantiation of this idea we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bit coin currency, without relying on a trusted authority (one of these protocols uses the Bit coin-based timed commitments mentioned above). Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example: if one party interrupts the protocol then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it we performed their transactions in the actual Bit coin system), and can be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. We think that this paradigm can have also other applications. We discu- s some of them.},

In practice PKI has been found to be a source for user errors, which could easily lead to security breaches. On the other hand usability problems hinder the usage and deployment of PKI-enabled applications and services. The dissertation at hand describes challenges specific for PKI technology with regard to usability and presents possible solutions. A general multi-layer model of methods to promote usable security is introduced as well as a generic tool for the analysis of PKI-enabled applications of any kind. The thesis subsequently exemplifies several applications of these concepts: Beside technical protection mechanisms, user sensitization and training are important pillars of IT security since a lot of security problems can be traced back to human error or negligence. We develop a new approach for security awareness campaigns aiming at long-term and sustainable changes in behaviour by means of direct user involvement. Delegating security-critical tasks is one possibility to face usability issues. Here we focus on PKI outsourcing, i.e. the operation of a trustcenter by a service provider. In this setting, a secure certificate enrolment process is of particular importance. We point out a weakness of the standard protocol and show how to repair it with the help of a four-eyes principle realized by distributed digital signatures. Our protocol requires a distributed key generation by two parties. For this purpose we present a new, efficient and provably secure algorithm for RSA. Most email programs already support encryption and digital signatures, but these features are hardly used in practice. An important reason for this is the unfavourable cost-benefit ratio from the user's point of view. We show how to improve this ratio with the help of opportunistic security. This allows using public key cryptography without certificates and the costs associated with them. PKI-based authentication schemes suffer from the restriction that, due to security reasons, cryptographic keys cannot be temporarily delegated to a proxy for instance during holidays. We present a uniform and seamless solution for the World Wide Web that supports all common authentication mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Anonymity in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system, users are identified only by public-keys. An attacker wishing to de-anonymize users will attempt to construct the one-to-many mapping between users and public-keys, and associate information external to the system with the users. Bitcoin tries to prevent this attack by storing the mapping of a user to his or her public-keys on that user’s node only and by allowing each user to generate as many public-keys as required. In this chapter we consider the topological structure of two networks derived from Bitcoin’s public transaction history. We show that the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure, provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system, and have implications for anonymity. We combine these structures with external information and techniques such as context discovery and flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which, at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximately US\$500,000.},

In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin that augments the protocol to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin's cryptographic construction, its integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.},

In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to block chains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},
